** Overview **
This Stock Management Program is a command-line tool that allows users to manage stock information
interactively. Users can create new portfolios, add stocks to existing portfolios, and view stocks
within a given portfolio. The program supports various operations including examining crossover
dates for a stock within a valid date range, calculating the performance of a stock on a specific
date, and computing the moving average for a stock given a date and number of days. Users can
purchase or sell shares on specific dates, manage the composition of a portfolio by determining
the list of stocks and the number of shares on a given date, and assess the value of a portfolio
at the end of a specific day. Additionally, the program allows viewing the distribution of value
within a portfolio, including the individual and total values of stocks. Users can save and load
portfolios from the PortfolioData database, re-balance portfolios on specific dates according to
inputted weights, and display the performance of portfolios over time as a bar chart in text view.
